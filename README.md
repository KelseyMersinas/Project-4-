 ## Project Overview
 We selected a dataset on wild mushroom classification aimed at identifying
 edibility. Given that there are over 14,000 species of mushrooms worldwide, ranging from perfectly edible to deadly, accurate mushroom
 identification is critical for foraging and safe consumption. Machine learning serves as an
 effective tool for quickly classifying mushrooms based on their characteristics, providing
 valuable information to individuals in the field. This app will be able to take given descriptors
 from users and will output a suggestion on if this is an species of edible mushroom or if this is a 
 poisonous species to avoid. 
 Included is are two intractable dashboards that aim to explore our data and showcase the 
 differences in wild mushroom characteristics. 

## Research Questions

We aim to explore several research questions related to mushroom edibility, including:

- **Characteristics of Poisonous Mushrooms**: What common features are shared among poisonous mushroom species?
- **Seasonality and Edibility**: Does the season in which a mushroom is found affect its edibility?
- **Impact of Color and Size**: Which of the two characteristics—color or shape—plays a larger role in determining the edibility of mushrooms?
