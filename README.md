 ## Project Overview
 For Project 4, we selected a dataset on wild mushroom classification aimed at identifying
 edibility. This dataset, sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, contains over
 50,000 entries representing various mushroom species. Given that there are over 14,000
 species of mushrooms worldwide, ranging from perfectly edible to deadly, accurate mushroom
 identification is critical for foraging and safe consumption. Machine learning serves as an
 effective tool for quickly classifying mushrooms based on their characteristics, providing
 valuable information to individuals in the field.

## Research Questions

We aim to explore several research questions related to mushroom edibility, including:

- **Characteristics of Poisonous Mushrooms**: What common features are shared among poisonous mushroom species?
- **Seasonality and Edibility**: Does the season in which a mushroom is found affect its edibility?
- **Impact of Color and Size**: Which of the two characteristics—color or shape—plays a larger role in determining the edibility of mushrooms?
